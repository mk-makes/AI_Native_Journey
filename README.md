## ðŸŒŸ What I'm Exploring / Features

* **Learning Resources:** Curated links and notes on AI-native tools, frameworks, and concepts.
* **Code Examples:** Small, focused code snippets and mini-projects demonstrating AI integration.
* **Project Logs:** Updates on personal AI projects, challenges faced, and solutions found.
* **Thoughts & Insights:** Reflections on the AI development landscape and my personal growth.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need Git installed to clone the repository. Depending on the specific projects I add, you might also need:

* **Python 3.x**
* **Node.js** (for web-based AI tools)
* Specific AI libraries (e.g., `transformers`, `tensorflow`, `pytorch`, `langchain`, etc.)
